# File-Encrypter
 A Web Application which can store files uploaded by the user in an encrypted format.

<h1>Workflow</h1>
<ul>
 <li>A user registers his/her account.</li>
 <li>After login, the user can upload files to this secure vault.</li>
 <li>After uploading, the website prompts a Java code to encrypt the file.</li>
 <li>The encrypted file is stored in the mysql database.</li>
 <li>When the user downloads it he will be able to see the file in encrypted format only.</li>
 <li>Hence, even if the attacker gets to know the login credentials of the user the attacker cannot access the file.</li>
 <li>However, the user may access/decrypt his/her file after downloading using the private key he used while uploading the file</li>
</ul>
